            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <img class="left1" src="./images/worker.jpg" alt="Worker">
            <p>The history of the “Cricova” Associated Wine Factory begins in 1952. There was a shortage of facilities for the storage and ageing of wines at that time in the Republic of Moldova. Following long searches, two outstanding personalities of Moldovan winemaking, Petru Ungureanu and Nicolae Sobolev, suggested to use the galleries resulting from building stone extraction as warehouses for the storage of wine. Before long it turned out that the wines produced at the Cricova Associated Wine Factory and aged in the underground silence possessed exceptional qualities.</p>
            <p>Our Winery is located in a unique place in the central region of the Republic of Moldova. The picturesque vineyards spread in the vicinity of the country’s most imposing natural and historical attractions – the natural forest reserve “Codrii” and the archaeological complex of Old Orhei. The Republic of Moldova is known to have a favorable climate with mild winters, plenty of sunny days, and the most fertile chernozem soil. At present, the company’s vineyards spread over an area of over 100 hectares. Villa Negra and Criuleni agricultural farms are located in the center of the country, whereas the Găvănoasa and Luceti farms are in the south.The geographic diversity of the vineyards belonging to the associated factory is yet another important benefit, namely the opportunity of cultivating various varieties of vines, depending on the climatic peculiarities and the soil of the location. As a result, the company cultivates such vine varieties as Muscat, Pinot Noir, Cabernet, Sauvignon and Merlot in the district of Cahul, whereas varieties such as Pinot, Sauvignon, Rkatn and Aligote are grown in the country’s central region.</p>
            <p class="clear1">The associated factory has long been standing out due to its advantages of complete production cycle and own raw materials. The control at every stage of the production process, from the planting of cuttings to the delivery of the finished products, has enabled  our Wineryto ensure superior quality, authenticity and originality of the formula of the wines produced here.</p>

            <h2>Production process</h2>
            <p>The associated factory has benefited since its very establishment from excellent premises for the production of wines of the highest quality, due to the natural conditions and the unique wine storage facilities. Nevertheless, the company has been investing in high-performance production equipment and machinery throughout all those years.Vlla Negra’s wines begin their lives in the picturesque vineyards in the center and the south of Moldova.Grapes are hand-picked in special limited weight containers, enabling thus their preservation under excellent conditions.</p>
            <p>The originality of wines is explained by the conditions of storage in the underground cellars, where the so-called wine-making stage takes place. One has created the ideal conditions for the success of this process in the cellars, in as much as the average temperature is +10 … + 12°C and the relative humidity of the air is 97-98% all year round. The latter indicator is of particular importance: the higher the relative humidity level, the lower the risk of wine loss.Our wine storage facilities lack artificial air conditioning or ventilation systems. A unique microclimate has been created here by nature herself, just perfect for the production and maturation of high quality wines.</p>
